🛡️ Level 2 — Vulnerable Resilience

Summary:
You handle ordinary stress moderately but feel destabilized by emotional or unexpected pressure. Recovery happens, but slowly and with emotional residue. You sometimes interpret hardship as personal failure rather than temporary turbulence.

Emotional Dynamics:
You show care and effort, but emotional resilience dips sharply when things don’t go as planned. After setbacks, self-doubt lingers longer than it should, leading to exhaustion or avoidance.

Psychological View:
You display conditional resilience — strong when supported, weaker in isolation. This means your coping system depends heavily on external stability.

Professional Advice:

Practice emotional self-validation: “This hurts, but I can handle it.”

Train adaptive reframing — view challenges as information, not judgment.

Keep a “resilience log” — list moments when you bounced back, no matter how small.

Therapist’s Note:
Your emotional system needs permission, not pressure. Allowing vulnerability without self-criticism is the first step to strong resilience.
