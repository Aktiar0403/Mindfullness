🔸 Level 3 — Moderate Overthinking

Summary:
You exhibit a healthy balance between reflection and spontaneity. You think deeply before acting, which helps in decision-making and empathy. However, during uncertainty or criticism, your brain tends to re-enter mild analysis loops.

Emotional Dynamics:
You process experiences through both emotional and logical filters. Stress or ambiguity triggers a temporary replay of events until you feel closure.

Psychological View:
This level shows strong prefrontal control over emotion but still moderate sensitivity to social judgment. You’re analytical but not obsessive.

Professional Advice:

Set time limits for complex thoughts.

Journal to “empty” repetitive thoughts from your mind.

Practice reframing — instead of “I might fail,” use “I’m still learning.”

Therapist’s Note:
You’re close to mastery — your awareness already protects you from spirals. Continue strengthening confidence under uncertainty.
