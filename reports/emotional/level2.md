# Emotional Intelligence Report – Level 2 (Below Average EQ)

You show some understanding of emotions, but emotional regulation and communication may still feel inconsistent. You might sense emotions rising but struggle to express them productively.

---

### 🧠 Emotional Understanding
You recognize certain emotional states but may misinterpret others. In stressful situations, rationality may fade, and communication may become abrupt or avoidant.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges
- Emotional awareness appears situational, not consistent.  
- Empathy is present but not always expressed.  
- Emotional fatigue after social or conflict-heavy interactions.

---

### 🌱 Growth Path
- Begin daily 5-minute emotional check-ins (What am I feeling? Why?).  
- Learn emotion vocabulary — differentiate irritation, anger, and frustration.  
- Observe your body’s early stress signals (shoulder tension, shallow breathing).
