# Emotional Intelligence Report – Level 1 (Extremely Low EQ)

Your emotional processing currently seems heavily disconnected. You may often feel misunderstood or overwhelmed by emotions — either suppressing them or reacting suddenly without clarity.

---

### 🧩 Emotional Awareness
You may not yet recognize the link between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Emotional moments might appear confusing or uncontrollable, and others may perceive you as distant or defensive.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges
- Difficulty labeling or identifying emotions in self and others.  
- Emotional reactivity, irritability, or social withdrawal.  
- Low tolerance for feedback or interpersonal tension.

### 🌱 Professional Guidance
At this stage, the focus is **recognition, not regulation**. Start with basic mindfulness — naming emotions when they appear (“I feel frustrated,” “I feel anxious”).  
Try journaling for 10 minutes daily about one emotional event, describing it factually first, then emotionally.
