🛡️ Level 1 — Fragile Resilience

Summary:
Your emotional system feels easily shaken by stress, criticism, or uncertainty. When faced with setbacks, your mind tends to move toward self-blame or withdrawal rather than problem-solving. This is not a sign of weakness — it means your brain is stuck in “threat mode” for too long after challenges, and has not yet learned to recover smoothly.

Emotional Dynamics:
You may feel overwhelmed by even small disruptions in plans or relationships. Emotional energy depletes fast, and you often struggle to “bounce back” or refocus. You likely internalize stress deeply, replaying it instead of releasing it.

Psychological View:
This reflects an overactivated stress-response circuit (amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortisol pathways). Chronic exposure to perceived threat reduces mental elasticity.

Professional Advice:

Focus on micro-wins — small achievements rebuild confidence neurologically.

Avoid perfectionism; it silently kills resilience.

Start journaling every recovery moment — even tiny ones — to train your brain to see progress.

Therapist’s Note:
You’re not fragile — you’re fatigued. Once you rest and practice gradual exposure to challenges, your natural resilience will awaken.
