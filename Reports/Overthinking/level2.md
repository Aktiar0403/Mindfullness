🔸 Level 2 — High Overthinking

Summary:
You have a sharp, observant mind that rarely misses details. But under stress, that precision shifts into hyper-analysis. You replay interactions or decisions to ensure nothing went wrong — a form of mental safety-checking.

Emotional Dynamics:
You crave control. Uncertainty feels unsafe, and your brain equates overanalyzing with preventing loss or regret. You often feel mental fatigue but struggle to let go of unresolved loops.

Psychological View:
Your cognitive pattern shows compulsive reflection — useful in moderation, draining in excess. The intent is logical safety; the cost is emotional peace.

Professional Advice:

Use the 80% rule: once 80% sure, decide and move forward.

Speak thoughts aloud to break mental echo chambers.

Replace “What if I’m wrong?” with “Can I handle it if I’m wrong?”

Therapist’s Note:
You have high conscientiousness — it’s not a flaw but an unbalanced strength. The next growth step is emotional trust, not more logic.
